    <h2>iop3.</h2>
    <p>Hello there. You've landed on this website. How impressive. Any reason for you to be here?<br>You must've clicked on a link like <a href="https://iop3.is-a.dev">this</a> one. Oh well. Since your here I better talk about my self.</p>
    <p>Anyways I'm iop3. (duh). I live in [REDACTED]. (duh). I had a python class in October 2020. There was only like 5 or 6 classes. I didn't learn much.<br>Later on I discovered replit. (yay). A few months later I found github.</p>
    <p>I started to learn html/css/js. Html was easy. Css wasn't my thing. Js isn't my thing either.</p>
